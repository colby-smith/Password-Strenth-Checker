A simple program that takes the input of a user's password and outputs improvements, if any, it can make. Utilising constant variables, basic Python arithmetic and functions, as well as error logic.

## Prerequisites
To use this program effectively make sure you have installed:

2. Copy and paste the code below and hit enter.
```

```
3. Wait for the downloads to be complete, then restart your computer.

4. After restarting your computer, you should see an "Ubuntu" Window open automatically once you log back in. If you don't, search for the "Ubuntu" or "WSL" program in the start menu and launch it.

5. The window will prompt you to enter a username and password. Make sure you remember these! These are the credentials for your Linux user.

## Installing python 3.12.2
If you're on Linux, there are some dependencies you'll need before installing pyenv. Run these commands to install them:

1. Only run these if you're using a Linux System.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt install -y libreadline-dev libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev libffi-dev
```
2. Run this to install pyenv with webi.
```
curl -sS https://webi.sh/pyenv | sh
```
3. Open your ~/.bashrc file in VS Code. You can do so by typing:
```
code ~/.bashrc
```
If you're using a Mac.
```
code ~/.zshrc
```
4. Add these lines to the bottom of the file in this order:
```
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

5. Finally close and reopen your terminal.

## Usage
